Python in the lab: a short introductory course
==============================================

This is a collection of Ipython notebooks used for a Python-in-the-lab 20-hour course, first given at the Politecnico of Turin, Italy in Jan-Feb 2017 for PhD students. The second edition, goven Winter of 2019, is quite different from the original one. It is free available downloading the V2019.2.X releases.

The idea is to learn the essential elements of Python by trying on 'real' problems. Something a PhD student or a researcher daily finds in a lab: reading files, make calcultations, plot results, do data fitting, image analysis, etc.

To open the notebooks, download the files into a directory on your computer and from that directory run:

    $ ipython notebook

This will open a new page in your browser with a list of the available notebooks.

Should this error `[TerminalIPythonApp] WARNING | File not found: u'notebook'` pop up, please install Jupyter by following the [instructions](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) and execute the following command to run the notebook:

    $ jupyter notebook

The Bk.zip file is a collection of files that have to be unzipped in a subfolder (such as Bk). They are used all along the notebooks.

The notebooks have been made using Python 3.X (with an exception, as written in the file for the 2017 edition)
